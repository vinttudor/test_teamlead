# The problem:
https://github.com/teamleadercrm/coding-test/blob/master/1-discounts.md


# The solution:

## This project was made under PHP 7.1

## test_example.php 
- the file for testing the ouput for the initial JSON order transformed in array and for the JSON order after the discounts are applied transformed in array

## discounts_sevice.php 
- the file that basically output the the JSON order after the discounts are applied (the service)

## config_discounts.php 
- the config file for the discounts, what discounts we apply with parameters

## config_sources.php 
- in this moment the sources are loaded from GIT, but in the "data" and "example-orders" folders there are also the JSON sources, the code for that is commented for now
